# README

This project is a collaboration between a front end student and a back end student trying to put react and rails together in a project for the first time.

When used, a seeded database is created that has some initial values to demonstrate functionality. The user can enter a new shape into the database by entering text into the date fields at the bottom of the page. The input values are added to the database in the PUT request against the database with the parameters defined by the user input which creates a new shape with the desired color.

The user can also delete a given shape or edit an entry that has already been made. The edited item is added back into the DB at the bottom of the list.
